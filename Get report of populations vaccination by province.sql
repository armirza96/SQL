-- Give a report of the populationâ€™s vaccination by province between January 1st
-- 2021 and July 22nd 2021. The report should include for each province and for
-- each type of vaccine, the total number of people using the type of vaccine. If a
-- person have been vaccinated with Pfizer twice then the person will be counted
-- only once for Pfizer. But if a person have been vaccinated one dose for Pfizer and
-- one dose for Moderna then the person is counted once for each type.
